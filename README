OSMPH Imagery Coverage Map
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

This project creates an HTML-based slippy map that shows the coverage of
satellite/aerial imagery in the Philippines that is available for tracing
by OpenStreetmap contributors.

The basic workflow for publishing such a map is as follows:

1. Create/edit the OSM file containing the imagery outlines.
2. Use osm2json.pj to convert the OSM file to a Javascript file
   containing the JSON representation of the data.
3. Upload the files to a web server.

Here are the details:

1. Create/edit the OSM file

   1.1. Use an OSM editor to create the OSM file.
   1.2. Each outline polygon should be closed and have the following tags:
        name=*  - The name of the group to which this outline belongs
                  (e.g. "Bing")
        color=* - The HTML color for this outline. This can be any
                  recognized CSS color string such as "red" or "#FFFFFF"
   1.3. For multipolygons, create a relation with the tag
        type=multipolygon and have a single role=outer way and any number
        of role=inner ways. Tag the outer way in the same way as in step
        1.2 and there is no need to add tags to the inner ways and the
        relation itself. It is also important the the outer and inner ways
        are closed polygons each.
   1.4. The OSM file must be saved as a basic OSM file (not a change or
        history OSM file) and with the filename "data.osm".
        
2. Use osm2json.pj to convert the OSM file

   2.1. Run osm2json.pl and pipe the output to "data.js".
   2.2. Test the created file by opening the local index.html in a web
        browser. The Leaflet JS files must be in a subdirectory named
        "dist".

3. Upload the files

   3.1. Upload index.html, data.js, and the dist subdirectory to a
        publicly-accessible web server.
   3.2. Test by loading the index.html file in a web browser.
